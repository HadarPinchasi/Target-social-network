FooBook Web App.
The app we developed is a web application that offers users functionalities for signing up, signing in, and engaging with a feed. It enables users to generate posts and comments, modify and remove comments and posts and even to even to express admiration by liking favorite posts.

Features:
Sign up- Users are able to establish an account by supplying a username, display name (first and last name), password, and profile image. Input validation guarantees that all mandatory fields are completed.
